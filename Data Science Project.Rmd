## Sequence Data

This [sequence data](https://github.com/rosatiem98/rosatiem98.github.io/blob/b683b09421b8428a629ebf75f9f32f0e1ba99ac7/plant_ITS%20(1).fasta) is a collection of DNA sequence of the entire ITS gene region in Angiosperm and Gymnosperm samples. 

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the evolutionary differences between angiosperm and gymnosperm specimens. From analyzing differences a phylogenetic tree is built around the ITS gene region of these two clades.
